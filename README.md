This is classic Minesweeper! 
You have a field with hidden mines, over which you must place flags 
so you know not to click there. The number in each box shows how many mines 
are in the up-to-8 boxes surrounding it on the board. Press "u" to uncover safe 
locations, and press and hold "f" to place flags. Good luck!

To run the project, ensure that all of the files are stored within the same
